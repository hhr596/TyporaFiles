**Background:**

 

You have recently taken a job as a bioinformatician in an NHS clinical **genomics unit**. 

The focus of the group is the use of NGS technology for patient care Within the unit the bioinformatics resources are relatively small (2 or 3 people) in a team of 7 or 8 – and you are the only person in the team with a computer science background. 

 

For one of your first tasks, the head of unit has asked you to produce **a short report on an informatics problem being faced**. This report should have three sections (about 6 pages in total), and an appendix.

.

Section1: An analysis of the problem, defining its scope

Section 2: A discussion of the strategies that could be followed to address the problem

Section 3: A recommendation of the strategy to be followed.

 

 

It is important that the report be accessible to someone who is scientifically literate, but not an expert computing or information systems. 

 

**Topic 2: Application of AI** 

The quantity of data available on human variants has massively expanded in the past year. It is expected that the amount data will increase even further (5 million genome project). The lab head has been to a number of talks which are highlighting the role that “deep learning” methods could play in interpreting genomics data in the context of disease. Should the lab begin to explore deep learning in its own work?

 

**Questions:**

What is deep learning?

Is it mature enough to deliver real benefit in a clinical setting?



## Discussion

What are the obstacles/key factors?

1. What types of data are involved?

inputs: gene/protein/amino acids sequence

processing: curated patterns

outputs: GO Annotations

(string text)

2. what types of AI do we have?

3. Are there any relevant applications?

4. Why the obsession with annotation?
4. What is the "Annotation"?

6. Dynamic Programming
7. What is deep learning?

Aspect -> problems

intersection of deep learning and genomics.
